Chernarus has been quarantined.  Remnants of the CDC are deploying mini-nukes to sanitise conurbations.  Military force has been authorised and all infected and non-infected persons are being shot on sight.  Armed with a backpack, map and army pistol, can you find a way to survive the spiralling chaos?
